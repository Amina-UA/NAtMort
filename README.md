Natural Mortality
Overview
Natural mortality (M) refers to the rate at which organisms in a population die due to causes other than fishing or human harvest. It is a key component in population dynamics models, particularly in fisheries science and ecological studies.

This repository provides resources, models, and data for estimating and understanding natural mortality in biological populations.
